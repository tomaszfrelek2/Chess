Q: How does the A.I. work?
<p>
A: As far as chess ai's go, it's no AlphaZero. My ai brute-forces every single possible move and counter move, and decides on the best move from there. This effectivly means that the ai can see 1 turn into the future, so it can be outplayed by even a novice player (it did however, give my 6-year-old brother a run for his money). The ai determains the "best" move by calculating the material and positional advantage that each move generates.
